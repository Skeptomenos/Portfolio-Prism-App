# Ralph Progress Log - Phase 5: Bug Fixes

## Codebase Patterns
- Import ValidationGates and related types from `portfolio_src.core.contracts`
- Pipeline services are initialized lazily in `_init_services()` method
- Instance variables for services use Optional[Type] = None pattern
- Tests run via `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` from src-tauri/python directory
- Pre-existing type errors exist (pandas stubs) - ignore them
- Use write_json_atomic from core/utils.py as reference for atomic writes
- Telemetry singleton accessed via get_telemetry()
- TDD approach: write failing test FIRST, then implement fix
- ValidationGates.get_pipeline_quality() returns the DataQuality object
- ValidationIssue.actual contains values as strings (e.g., "85.5%")
