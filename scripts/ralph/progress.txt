# Ralph Progress Log
# Feature: Validation Gates Integration (Phase 2)
# Branch: ralph/validation-gates-integration
# Started: 2026-01-10

## Codebase Patterns
- Import ValidationGates and related types from `portfolio_src.core.contracts`
- Pipeline services are initialized lazily in `_init_services()` method
- Instance variables for services use Optional[Type] = None pattern
- Tests run via `uv run pytest tests/` from src-tauri/python directory
- Pre-existing test failures exist (10 failed) - unrelated to validation gates work

## 2026-01-10 17:35 - US-001
- What was implemented: Added ValidationGates import and instance variable to Pipeline class
- Files changed: src-tauri/python/portfolio_src/core/pipeline.py
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The contracts module exports all needed types from `portfolio_src.core.contracts`
  - Import includes: ValidationGates, LoadPhaseOutput, DecomposePhaseOutput, EnrichPhaseOutput, AggregatePhaseOutput, ETFDecomposition, AggregatedExposureRecord, DataQuality, IssueSeverity, dataframe_to_loaded_positions, dataframe_to_holdings
  - Pre-existing type errors exist in _write_breakdown_report (line ~644) - not related to this work
