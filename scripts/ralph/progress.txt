# Ralph Progress Log - Phase 5: Bug Fixes
Started: Sun Jan 11 2026
PRD: prd-phase5.json
---

## 2026-01-11 10:35 - US-001
- Implemented defensive NaN handling in asset_class split
- Files changed:
  - `portfolio_src/core/pipeline.py` - Added `.fillna('').str.upper()` pattern
  - `tests/test_phase5_bugfixes.py` - New test file for Phase 5 bug fixes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Modern pandas handles None gracefully in `.str.upper()`, but explicit `.fillna('')` is more defensive
  - Pre-existing test failures exist on main (10+ tests) - these are unrelated to Phase 5 changes
  - Patch database functions at `portfolio_src.data.database.get_positions`, not at pipeline module level

## 2026-01-11 10:40 - US-002
- Implemented weight format auto-detection in decomposer
- Files changed:
  - `portfolio_src/core/services/decomposer.py` - Added `_normalize_weight_format()` helper function
  - `tests/test_phase5_bugfixes.py` - Added 4 tests for weight format detection
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Weight columns can be named: weight, Weight, weight_pct, Weight_Pct
  - Detection heuristic: if max(weights) <= 1.0 AND sum(weights) <= 2.0, it's decimal format
  - Normalization happens in `_get_holdings()` after fetching, before ISIN resolution

## 2026-01-11 10:41 - US-003
- Made Hive contribution asynchronous using daemon thread
- Files changed:
  - `portfolio_src/core/services/decomposer.py` - Added `_contribute_to_hive_async()` helper, replaced sync call
  - `tests/test_phase5_bugfixes.py` - Added 3 tests for async Hive contribution
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `threading.Thread(target=fn, daemon=True)` for fire-and-forget operations
  - Daemon threads don't block process exit
  - Mock `get_hive_client` at module level: `portfolio_src.core.services.decomposer.get_hive_client`
  - Time-based tests: use `time.sleep()` in mock side_effect to simulate slow operations
---

## Codebase Patterns
- Import ValidationGates and related types from `portfolio_src.core.contracts`
- Pipeline services are initialized lazily in `_init_services()` method
- Instance variables for services use Optional[Type] = None pattern
- Tests run via `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` from src-tauri/python directory
- Pre-existing type errors exist (pandas stubs) - ignore them
- Use write_json_atomic from core/utils.py as reference for atomic writes
- Telemetry singleton accessed via get_telemetry()
- TDD approach: write failing test FIRST, then implement fix
- ValidationGates.get_pipeline_quality() returns the DataQuality object
- ValidationIssue.actual contains values as strings (e.g., "85.5%")
