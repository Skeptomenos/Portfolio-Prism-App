# Product Guidelines

## Visual Aesthetic: Modern Professional Minimalist
A hybrid approach that combines the premium feel of **Modern Glassmorphism** (subtle transparency and soft blurs) with the clarity of **Minimalist Professional** design. 
- **Palette:** Neutral, sophisticated tones with high-contrast typography to ensure data legibility.
- **Components:** Clean lines and purposeful white space, using glass-like surfaces only where they enhance the hierarchy without distracting from the data.

## Tone of Voice: Professional & Assuring
The application speaks with a voice of **Precision and Trust**. 
- **Style:** Objective and clear, avoiding jargon where possible but maintaining technical accuracy.
- **Goal:** To reassure the user that their sensitive financial data is handled with the utmost care and professional rigor.

## Core UX Principles
- **Transparent Analytics & Reporting:** "Show your work" philosophy. Every metric should have clear explanations of its calculation. Hive contributions and community ISIN resolutions must be explicitly labeled.
- **Instant Feedback Loop:** The UI should facilitate a two-way conversation. Users can provide feedback, view the live roadmap, and vote on upcoming features directly within the app.
- **Local-First Responsiveness:** Leveraging the local architecture to provide near-instant interaction response times, reinforcing the "sovereign" feel of the application.

## Onboarding & Education: Contextual Guidance
Rather than a forced walkthrough, the app employs **Contextual Help**.
- **Inline Explanations:** Complex metrics and privacy-related settings feature immediate explanations or "Learn More" tooltips.
- **Discovery:** Features are introduced in-situ as the user interacts with relevant data points, ensuring a low barrier to entry for advanced analytics.
