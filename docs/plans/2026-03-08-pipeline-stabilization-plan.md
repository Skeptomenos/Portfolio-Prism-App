## Primary Objective

**100% ISIN enrichment for all holdings.** Every holding extracted from every ETF must have
a resolved ISIN. This is the single most important pipeline metric. Without ISINs, there is
no True Holding Exposure, no cross-ETF overlap detection, and no meaningful Hive contributions.

The pipeline is only successful when:
1. Every tier1 holding (weight > threshold) has a resolved ISIN
2. Every resolved ISIN is contributed to the Hive
3. The resulting True Exposure correctly aggregates holdings by ISIN across all ETFs and direct positions

## Secondary Objectives

- All pipeline stages produce truthful, visible results (never silent failures)
- Hive contribution works for ETF holdings (not just direct stocks)
- Data quality scores reflect reality

## Domain Context: ISIN-First Strategy

The core value proposition of Portfolio Prism is **ISIN-level aggregation**:

1. **The Problem:** ETF providers give tickers for each underlying holding (e.g., `AAPL`, `AZN.L`).
   Tickers are market-specific — `AAPL` on NASDAQ vs `APC` on Xetra are different listings
   of the same company. You cannot map a ticker from one exchange to a ticker on another.
2. **The Solution:** The pipeline resolves every ticker to its **ISIN** (International Securities
   Identification Number), which is the globally unique identifier. Only with ISINs can you
   detect that your NVIDIA stock and the NVIDIA inside your MSCI World ETF are the same holding.
3. **The Pipeline:** Decompose ETF → Resolve Ticker-to-ISIN → Enrich with metadata (sector/geo) →
   Aggregate by ISIN for **True Holding Exposure**.
4. **The Hive:** Because external API resolution (Wikidata, Finnhub) is slow and rate-limited,
   every successful Ticker → ISIN resolution is auto-contributed to the Supabase **Hive** database.
   The idea: every user contributing makes the experience better for the next user.
   This is opt-in-by-default (setting `hive_contribution_enabled`, default `"true"`).

**Without ISIN resolution, the pipeline produces nothing meaningful.** Decomposition extracts
tickers but the critical ticker→ISIN mapping is where the value lies. This is why P-11 is the
highest priority remaining fix.

## Architecture Summary

The pipeline is a 6-phase linear orchestrator in `core/pipeline.py`:

```
LOAD → DECOMPOSE → RESOLVE ISINs → ENRICH → AGGREGATE → REPORT → HARVEST
```

| Phase | Service | What it does | Key dependency |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| 1. Load | `_load_portfolio()` | Reads positions from SQLite, splits into direct (stocks) vs ETFs | `data/database.py` |
| 2. Decompose | `Decomposer` | X-rays ETFs into underlying holdings via adapter → cache → Hive cascade | `adapters/registry.py`, `holdings_cache` |
| 3. Resolve | `ISINResolver` (inside Decomposer) | Resolves tickers to ISINs via: local_cache → Hive → Wikidata → Finnhub → yFinance | `data/resolution.py` |
| 4. Enrich | `Enricher` | Adds sector/geography metadata via `HiveEnrichmentService` | `HiveClient`, proxy worker |
| 5. Aggregate | `Aggregator` | Fuses direct + ETF holdings by ISIN, normalizes weights, groups by sector/region | Pure computation |
| 6. Report | `_write_reports()` | Writes exposure CSV, holdings breakdown, health report, error log | `SnapshotRepository` |
| 7. Harvest | `harvest_cache()` | Auto-contributes newly-resolved ISINs to Hive (non-fatal) | `HiveClient` |

### ISIN Resolution Cascade (per holding)

```
1. Provider ISIN (if the adapter already gave one)       → confidence 1.00
2. Manual enrichments (user-provided ticker→ISIN map)    → confidence 0.85
3. LocalCache (SQLite backed by Hive sync, 1000 entries) → confidence 0.95
4. Hive network lookup (Supabase listings table)         → confidence 0.90
5. API calls (tier1 only, weight > threshold):
   a. Wikidata SPARQL                                    → confidence 0.80
   b. Finnhub (via Cloudflare Worker proxy)               → confidence 0.75
   c. yFinance (unreliable fallback)                      → confidence 0.70
6. Mark as unresolved
```

Holdings below `tier1_threshold` (0.1% weight) are skipped as tier2 — not worth the API call.

### Hive Contribution Flow

Hive contribution happens at two points:
1. **During ISIN resolution**: When an API call resolves a ticker→ISIN, the result is
   pushed to Hive via `_push_to_hive()` — making it available for all users.
2. **During harvest**: After pipeline completes, `harvest_cache()` bulk-contributes
   newly-discovered securities to the Hive `assets` and `listings` tables.

The Hive itself is a Supabase PostgreSQL database with:
- `assets` (ISIN → name, asset_class)
- `listings` (ticker/exchange → ISIN) — **the key table for resolution**
- `aliases` (name → ISIN)
- `etf_holdings` (ETF ISIN → holdings + weights)
- `contributions` (audit log)

### Key Contracts

- **Pipeline result**: `PipelineResult(success, etfs_processed, etfs_failed, total_value, errors, warnings, harvested_count)`
- **Pipeline report envelope**: `PipelineReportEnvelope` with statuses `missing | invalid | ready`
- **Run status**: `success` derived from `(etfs_succeeded / etfs_total) >= 0.5` (fixed in P-07)
- **Health report**: Written to `outputs/pipeline_health.json` — consumed by Health route and X-Ray UI

---

## Test & Dogfood Plan

### Phase 0: ISIN Resolution Rate (PRIMARY METRIC)

**This is the most important test phase. Every other phase is secondary to this.**

Per spec (`docs/specs/identity_resolution_details.md` Section 15):
- Resolution Rate target: **>95%** of holdings resolved
- Cache Hit Rate target: **>80%** from local/Hive
- API Dependency target: **<20%** of resolutions hit external APIs

Per architecture (`docs/architecture/identity_resolution.md`):
- Identity Resolution is **Stage 0** of the pipeline — before decomposition can aggregate
- Without ISINs, "NVIDIA CORP" and "NVIDIA Corp" are treated as different securities
- Every API success is contributed to Hive — community builds shared knowledge base

| # | Test | How | Expected |
|---|------|-----|----------|
| Z1 | ISIN resolution rate per ETF | Check `resolution_stats` per ETF after pipeline run | >80% for each ETF |
| Z2 | Overall ISIN resolution rate | Check aggregate resolution stats | >80% across all 3,522+ holdings |
| Z3 | Zero unresolved tier1 holdings | Check for tier1 holdings (weight > 0.1%) without ISINs | 0 unresolved tier1 |
| Z4 | Resolution sources distribution | Check `by_source` in resolution stats | Mix of local_cache, hive, api (not all "skipped") |
| Z5 | Hive contributions from ETF resolution | Check Hive contribution count after run | Includes newly-resolved ETF holdings (not just 20 direct stocks) |
| Z6 | True Exposure shows cross-ETF overlap | Check Dashboard True Exposure section | Shows holdings appearing in multiple ETFs (e.g., NVIDIA, Apple) |
| Z7 | Resolved ISINs are valid format | Validate all resolved ISINs match `^[A-Z]{2}[A-Z0-9]{9}[0-9]$` | 100% valid |
| Z8 | Second run has higher Hive hit rate | Run pipeline twice | Second run has higher `hive_hit_rate` (contributed ISINs now in cache) |

### Phase A: Pipeline Trigger & Basic Execution

| # | Test | How | Expected |
|---|------|-----|----------|
| A1 | Trigger pipeline from X-Ray UI | Click "Run Analysis" in browser | Progress bar 0→100%, no blank screen |
| A2 | Pipeline runs with 30 real positions | Engine has synced portfolio | Processes 10 ETFs, ~20 stocks |
| A3 | Pipeline result contract | Inspect `PipelineResult` return | `success` or `degraded`, never silent |
| A4 | SSE progress events reach frontend | Watch network tab during run | `pipeline_summary` SSE event received |
| A5 | Pipeline report written to disk | Check `outputs/pipeline_health.json` | Valid JSON, matches health report schema |
| A6 | Error handling on empty portfolio | Run with no positions | Explicit `failed` state with fix hint, not crash |

### Phase B: ETF Decomposition

| # | Test | How | Expected |
|---|------|-----|----------|
| B1 | Decompose all cached ETFs | Run pipeline | 8+ ETFs decomposed from cache |
| B2 | Decompose Amundi ETFs (known failure) | Check per_etf results | Explicit `failed` status, not silent skip |
| B3 | Adapter fallback cascade | Clear cache for one ETF, re-run | Hits Hive → adapter → reports source |
| B4 | Weight sum validation | Check per-ETF weight sums | All within 95-105% range |
| B5 | Resolution stats visibility | Check resolution summary in UI | Shows resolved/unresolved/skipped counts |
| B6 | Unresolved items list | Check X-Ray NeedsAttention section | Lists unresolved holdings with ticker, name, weight, reason |

### Phase C: ISIN Resolution & Identity

| # | Test | How | Expected |
|---|------|-----|----------|
| C1 | Resolution cascade order | Check resolution sources | local_cache → Hive → external APIs |
| C2 | Tier2 skipped holdings | Check `tier2_skipped` count | Reported in resolution stats, not hidden |
| C3 | Resolution confidence scores | Check resolution output | Scores match: direct=1.0, cache=0.95, hive=0.90, api=0.70-0.80 |
| C4 | ISINResolver respects threshold | Check `tier1_threshold` behavior | Holdings below threshold get ticker-only resolution |
| C5 | Weight column recognized for all adapters | Check weight is non-zero during resolution | `weight_percentage` column must be included |

### Phase D: Enrichment

| # | Test | How | Expected |
|---|------|-----|----------|
| D1 | Enrichment sources tracked | Check enrichment stats in health report | Shows hive_hits, api_calls, contributions counts |
| D2 | Sector coverage for resolved holdings | Check sector distribution in output | >50% of resolved holdings have sector |
| D3 | Geography coverage gap | Check geography in output | Document actual rate, flag if <10% |
| D4 | Enrichment failure handling | If Finnhub/Wikidata unavailable | Graceful degradation, not pipeline crash |

### Phase E: Aggregation & Reports

| # | Test | How | Expected |
|---|------|-----|----------|
| E1 | Exposure report written | Check `outputs/exposure_report.csv` | Valid CSV with ISIN, sector, weight, value columns |
| E2 | Holdings breakdown written | Check breakdown report | Contains both direct and indirect holdings |
| E3 | Total value matches portfolio | Compare pipeline total vs TR sync total | Within 1% of each other |
| E4 | Data quality score truthfulness | Check `data_quality.is_trustworthy` | `false` if >20% of holdings unresolved |

### Phase F: Hive Contribution & Community

| # | Test | How | Expected |
|---|------|-----|----------|
| F1 | Hive contributions logged | Check `monitor.contributions` | Non-zero if new ISINs resolved via API |
| F2 | Hive hit rate tracked | Check `hive_hit_rate` in metrics | Reports percentage correctly |
| F3 | Hive log visible in UI | Check X-Ray HiveLog component | Shows hits and contributions lists |
| F4 | Contribution failure handling | If Supabase unavailable | Pipeline continues, contribution logged as pending/failed |
| F5 | Harvest runs without crash | Check `harvested_count` in result | Returns count or 0, never crashes pipeline |
| F6 | Hive contribution visibility in Health | Check Health route | Shows freshness/trust/coverage for Hive data |

### Phase G: Frontend X-Ray UI

| # | Test | How | Expected |
|---|------|-----|----------|
| G1 | X-Ray view renders pipeline stepper | Navigate to X-Ray | Shows PipelineStepper component |
| G2 | Action queue shows pending actions | Before pipeline run | Shows "Run Analysis" or stale indicator |
| G3 | Resolution table shows per-ETF results | After pipeline run | Table with ISIN, status, source, holdings count |
| G4 | Resolution health card | After pipeline run | Shows resolution rate, confidence distribution |
| G5 | Needs attention section | After pipeline run | Lists unresolved holdings with reasons |
| G6 | Hive log section | After pipeline run | Shows community hits and contributions |
| G7 | Error boundary catches crashes | If pipeline component throws | XRayErrorBoundary shows recovery UI, not blank screen |

### Phase H: Pipeline Report Envelope Contract

| # | Test | How | Expected |
|---|------|-----|----------|
| H1 | Report envelope before pipeline run | Call `getPipelineReport()` | Returns `{status: 'missing'}` or `{status: 'ready', report: {...}}` |
| H2 | Report envelope after pipeline run | Call `getPipelineReport()` | Returns `{status: 'ready', report: {...}}` with valid health data |
| H3 | Report envelope with corrupted file | Corrupt `pipeline_health.json` | Returns `{status: 'invalid'}`, not crash |
| H4 | Frontend renders each envelope state | Check Health/X-Ray routes | Each state has intentional UI, never blank |

---

## Execution Order

1. **A1-A5**: Start with basic pipeline trigger — confirms the engine can run the pipeline
2. **B1-B6**: Decomposition is the core — most issues will surface here
3. **F1-F6**: Hive contribution is integral to decomposition — test alongside
4. **C1-C4**: Resolution drives everything downstream
5. **D1-D4**: Enrichment coverage determines final quality
6. **E1-E4**: Reports are the output contract
7. **G1-G7**: Frontend rendering (we already have 4 E2E specs for route-level checks)
8. **H1-H4**: Envelope contract (already tested in `tests/integration/ipc.test.ts`)

## Questions Before Execution

1. **Supabase credentials**: Does this machine have `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` configured? Hive tests (Phase F) require these. If not, contribution tests will verify graceful degradation only.

2. **Finnhub/external API keys**: Are Finnhub, Wikidata, or other enrichment API keys configured? Enrichment tests (Phase D) depend on this. Without them, we test cache-only enrichment.

3. **Amundi ETFs**: The investigation report shows 2 Amundi ETFs (LU0908500753, FR0010361683) always fail. Is fixing these in scope, or should we document and move on?

4. **`is_trustworthy` threshold**: The pipeline currently reports `quality_score=1.0` and `is_trustworthy=true` even with 44% skipped holdings. Should we fix this to be stricter, or is tier2_skipped intentionally excluded from the trust calculation?

## Headed Browser Dogfood Log

### Session: 2026-03-08 ~22:44

**Setup:** Engine with full env (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, FINHUB_API_KEY), adapter_registry.json manually deployed to runtime config dir.

### Critical Finding: adapter_registry.json not deployed on fresh machines

The lifecycle code tries to copy default configs from `src-tauri/default_config/` but the actual
config files live at `src-tauri/python/default_config/` and `src-tauri/python/config/`. This path
mismatch means `adapter_registry.json` never reaches `~/Library/Application Support/PortfolioPrism/config/`.
Without it, the AdapterRegistry is empty and ALL ETF decomposition fails.

**Fix required:** Either fix the lifecycle copy path, or have the registry fall back to the source-tree config.

### Pipeline Run Results (after manual adapter config deploy)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 170s |
| ETFs processed | 1/10 |
| ETFs failed | 9/10 |
| Total underlying | 370 |
| Hive hit rate | 76.3% |
| Contributions | 88 ISINs |
| Quality score | 0.49 |
| is_trustworthy | false |
| Console errors | 0 |

### ETF Decomposition Detail

| ETF | Status | Source | Holdings |
|-----|--------|--------|----------|
| IE00BL25JP72 (MSCI World Momentum) | success | cached | 370 |
| IE00B4L5Y983 (Core MSCI World) | failed | unknown | 0 |
| IE00B3WJKG14 (S&P 500 IT) | failed | unknown | 0 |
| IE00B53SZB19 (NASDAQ100) | failed | unknown | 0 |
| IE0031442068 (Core S&P 500 Dist) | failed | unknown | 0 |
| IE00B5BMR087 (Core S&P 500 Acc) | failed | unknown | 0 |
| DE000A0F5UF5 (NASDAQ100 Dist) | failed | unknown | 0 |
| IE00BYVQ9F29 (NASDAQ100 EUR) | failed | unknown | 0 |
| LU0908500753 (Amundi Stoxx 600) | failed | amundi (manual) | 0 |
| FR0010361683 (Amundi MSCI India) | failed | amundi (manual) | 0 |

**Root cause for 7 iShares failures:** Adapters try to scrape provider websites but return empty results.
Cache is empty on this machine. Hive does not have ETF holdings data for these ISINs.

**Root cause for 2 Amundi failures:** Amundi adapter requires manual file upload (by design).
These should be documented as expected behavior.

### UI Verification (all routes)

| Route | Renders | Console errors | Notable |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------|
| Dashboard | OK | 0 | True Exposure shows cross-ETF overlap |
| X-Ray ETF Resolution | OK | 0 | 1 resolved, 9 failed with clear status |
| X-Ray Action Queue | OK | 0 | 9 issues with Fix/Ignore buttons |
| X-Ray Hive Log | OK | 0 | 283 from Hive, 88 contributed, 76% hit rate |
| Health | OK | 0 | Quality 49%, 9 active issues, is_trustworthy=false |
| Holdings | OK | 0 | Full position table |

## Implementation Plan

### Issue Index (verified 2026-03-08)

| ID | Issue | Severity | Root Cause (VERIFIED) | Status |
|------|-------|----------|------------|--------|
| P-01 | Config files not deployed to runtime dir | Critical | `resource_path()` goes up 3 dirs instead of 2 | **COMPLETE** (8/10 ETFs decompose, 3522 holdings) |
| P-02 | 7 iShares adapters return empty holdings | Critical | **Same root cause as P-01.** `ishares_config.json` not deployed = no product IDs = auto-discovery fails | MERGED INTO P-01 |
| P-03 | 2 Amundi ETFs require manual upload | Medium | By design - Amundi blocks automated downloads | documented |
| P-04 | `is_trustworthy` threshold | Resolved | Already correct: `score >= 0.95`, penalties CRITICAL=0.25, HIGH=0.10. Current run shows 0.49 = correctly untrusted | verify only |
| P-05 | Geography coverage 4.2% | Medium | Enrichment APIs don't return geography consistently | investigate |
| P-06 | 44% tier2_skipped not reflected in UI | Low | Skipped holdings have tickers but aren't surfaced in NeedsAttention | deferred |
| P-07 | Pipeline returns `success: true` despite 9/10 ETFs failing | High | `pipeline.py:583` hardcoded `success=True` | **COMPLETE** (derived from ETF ratio, 6 tests) |
| P-08 | Hive contribution default verified correct | Resolved | Default is `"true"` in code; this machine had persisted `"false"` | no change needed |
| P-09 | WORKER_URL for enrichment proxy | Resolved | Hardcoded Cloudflare Worker default in `config.py:56`. No env var needed. | no change needed |
| P-10 | Frontend has no `degraded` concept | Note | `RunPipelineResultSchema` is binary `success: boolean`. XRayView throws on `success=false`. No `runStatus` field. | assess with P-07 |
| P-11 | ISIN resolution at 0% due to weight column mismatch | **Critical** | `weight_percentage` missing from decomposer lookup | **COMPLETE** (99.9% resolution, 852/853) |
| P-12 | Enrichment only covers direct stocks, not ETF holdings | **Critical** | Downstream of P-11 | **investigate** (enrichment count barely changed post-P-11) |
| P-13 | Health report shows 0% resolution despite 99.9% actual | High | Health report writer reads wrong/stale resolution stats from decomposer | **investigate** |
| P-14 | Aggregated total differs from portfolio by 84.8% | **Critical** | Aggregator likely treats ETF-internal weights as portfolio-level weights without scaling by ETF portfolio weight | **investigate** |
| P-15 | Resolution source field is `nan` for ~490 of 852 resolved holdings | Medium | Resolver returns `source=None` for local_cache hits; not propagated to output CSV | **investigate** |
| P-16 | First pipeline run takes ~21 minutes (1269s) | Medium | ISIN resolution makes API calls (Wikidata SPARQL) for ~188 tier1 uncached tickers per ETF; expected to improve on second run via Hive cache | **verify** (run pipeline again) |
| P-17 | True Exposure stored as CSV (legacy) — needs SQLite with historical tracking | High | CSV cannot track changes over time; need timestamped snapshots in prism.db for 3/6/12 month comparison | **pending** |
| P-18 | Hive decomposition contributions lack freshness timestamps | Medium | Without `contributed_at` / `source_date`, staleness cannot be assessed; adapter should be preferred over stale Hive data (>30 days) | **pending** |

### P-01: Fix `resource_path()` overshooting by 1 directory level (CRITICAL)

**Cascading root cause for P-01 AND P-02.**

**Root cause (VERIFIED):** `lifecycle.py:62` goes up 3 `dirname()` levels from `headless/lifecycle.py`:
```
headless/lifecycle.py
  up1: portfolio_src/headless/  ->  portfolio_src/
  up2: portfolio_src/           ->  python/          <- CORRECT STOP (default_config/ lives here)
  up3: python/                  ->  src-tauri/        <- WRONG (current code)
```
`resource_path('default_config/X')` resolves to `src-tauri/default_config/X` (MISSING)
instead of `src-tauri/python/default_config/X` (EXISTS).

**Cascading impact (3 config files fail to deploy):**
- `adapter_registry.json` -> empty AdapterRegistry -> "No adapter registered" for all ETFs
- `ishares_config.json` -> no product IDs -> iShares auto-discovery scrapes website and fails -> "empty holdings"
- `ticker_map.json` -> ticker resolution fallback missing

#### Fix

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src-tauri/python/portfolio_src/headless/lifecycle.py:62` | Change 3 `dirname()` calls to 2 |
| `src-tauri/python/portfolio_src/headless/test_lifecycle.py` | Add test: `resource_path('default_config/adapter_registry.json')` resolves to existing file |

#### TDD Steps
1. **Red:** Add test asserting `resource_path('default_config/adapter_registry.json')` returns an existing path.
2. **Fix lifecycle.py line 62:** `base_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(base_path))` (2 levels, not 3).
3. **Green:** Run test.
4. **Integration:** Delete runtime config dir, restart engine, verify all 3 config files deployed.
5. **Dogfood:** Re-run pipeline, verify iShares ETFs decompose.

#### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `resource_path('default_config/adapter_registry.json')` resolves to existing file
- [ ] All 3 config files auto-deployed to `CONFIG_DIR` on engine boot
- [ ] iShares ETFs decompose (at least 5/7 succeed from adapter or cache)

#### Result (VERIFIED)
- lifecycle.py line 62: changed 3 `dirname()` to 2
- Also fixed pre-existing logging bug: `extra={'filename': ...}` -> `extra={'config_file': ...}`
- **Before fix:** 1/10 ETFs decomposed, 9 failed
- **After fix:** 8/10 ETFs decomposed (1330+77+515+508+107+107+370+508 = 3,522 holdings), 2 Amundi fail as expected
- Evidence: `output/playwright/dogfood/xray-after-p01-fix.png`
- [ ] Pipeline health report shows `source: ishares_adapter` or `source: cached` (not `unknown`)

---

### P-02: MERGED INTO P-01

The 7 iShares failures have the same root cause as P-01.
When `ishares_config.json` is deployed, the adapter has product IDs and can download CSV holdings.
No separate fix needed.

---

### P-03: Amundi manual upload (DOCUMENTED)

Expected behavior. Action Queue shows download URLs. No code change.

---

### P-04: `is_trustworthy` threshold (VERIFIED CORRECT)

**Verdict:** Already working correctly. No code change needed.

The quality system at `quality.py:11,141` uses `is_trustworthy = score >= 0.95` with penalties:
- CRITICAL: 0.25 (one critical issue -> score 0.75 -> untrusted)
- HIGH: 0.10 (one high issue -> score 0.90 -> untrusted)
- MEDIUM: 0.03
- LOW: 0.01

Current pipeline run correctly shows `quality_score: 0.49, is_trustworthy: false`.
The real problem is P-07: the pipeline returns `success: true` despite `is_trustworthy: false`.

---

### P-05: Geography coverage 4.2% (INVESTIGATE)

**Priority:** Medium
**Root cause hypothesis:** Enrichment APIs (Finnhub via WORKER_URL proxy, Wikidata) return sector but not geography consistently.
**WORKER_URL:** Verified configured with hardcoded default (`config.py:56`).

#### Investigation steps
1. After P-01 fix, re-run pipeline with full ETF decomposition.
2. Check enrichment output for geography column coverage.
3. If still <10%, trace enrichment API responses to identify the gap.
4. Document as known limitation if no reliable geography source exists.

---

### P-07: Pipeline `success` should reflect ETF processing results (COMPLETE)

**Root cause (VERIFIED):** `pipeline.py:583` hardcodes `success=True` in the try block.
Only goes `false` if an exception is caught. ETF decomposition failures don't throw.

**Frontend impact (VERIFIED):** `XRayView.tsx:63` checks `result.success` and only shows
error UI when `false`. With `success: true`, the frontend shows no error despite 9/10 ETFs failing.

**IPC contract (VERIFIED):** `RunPipelineResultSchema` is `{success: boolean, errors: string[], durationMs: number}`.
No `degraded` or `runStatus` concept exists. Binary success/failure.

#### Fix

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src-tauri/python/portfolio_src/core/pipeline.py:582-583` | Derive `success` from ETF processing results |
| `src-tauri/python/tests/test_pipeline.py` (or existing) | Add test: success=false when >50% ETFs fail |

#### TDD Steps
1. **Red:** Add test: `PipelineResult.success == False` when >50% of ETFs fail.
2. **Fix pipeline.py `run()` method** (line 582-583):
   ```python
   etfs_total = len(etf_positions)
   etfs_succeeded = len(holdings_map)
   pipeline_success = etfs_total == 0 or (etfs_succeeded / etfs_total) >= 0.5
   return PipelineResult(success=pipeline_success, ...)
   ```
3. **Green:** Run test.
4. **Dogfood:** Re-run pipeline with current state (1/10 ETFs), verify `success: false`.
5. **Frontend check:** Verify X-Ray shows error UI when `success: false`.

#### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `success=false` when >50% of ETFs fail
- [ ] Frontend shows error message when `success=false`
- [ ] `success=true` only when majority of ETFs succeed or portfolio has no ETFs

#### Result (VERIFIED)
- pipeline.py:582: `success` now derived from `(etfs_succeeded / etfs_total) >= 0.5`
- 6 unit tests for derivation logic (all pass)
- With P-01 fix in place: 8/10 ETFs succeed -> pipeline reports `success=True` (correct)
- Without P-01 fix (1/10): would report `success=False` (correct)

### P-09: WORKER_URL for enrichment (RESOLVED)

Hardcoded Cloudflare Worker default at `config.py:56`. No env var needed. Not a problem.

---

### P-10: Frontend has no `degraded` concept (ASSESS)

The `RunPipelineResultSchema` is binary `{success: boolean}`. There's no way to express
"pipeline ran but with partial results" in the current IPC contract.

**Future work:** Consider adding `runStatus: 'success' | 'degraded' | 'failed'` to the schema
so the frontend can show nuanced state. For now, P-07's binary fix is sufficient.

## Execution Order (Updated post-P-11)

**Objective:** achieve 100% success of the Pipeline Definition of Done
(`docs/specs/pipeline_definition_of_done.md`).

```
COMPLETED:
  P-01 (resource_path fix) ------> 8/10 ETFs decompose, 3522 holdings
  P-07 (success truthfulness) ---> derived from ETF ratio
  P-11 (weight column fix) ------> 99.9% ISIN resolution (852/853)

REMAINING (priority order):

  P-14 (total mismatch 84.8%) ---> CRITICAL: aggregator weight scaling broken
    |                                True Exposure numbers are wrong
    v
  P-13 (health report 0%) -------> HIGH: report writer shows wrong resolution stats
    |
    v
  P-12 (enrichment scaling) -----> CRITICAL: enrichment didn't scale with ISINs
    |
    v
  P-17 (true exposure storage) --> HIGH: migrate from CSV to SQLite with timestamps
    |
    v
  P-15 (source field nan) -------> MEDIUM: ~490 resolved holdings lack source tracking
    |
    v
  P-18 (Hive freshness) ---------> MEDIUM: add contributed_at/source_date to Hive
    |
    v
  P-16 (21min runtime) ----------> VERIFY: second run should be faster via Hive cache
    |
    v
  P-05 (geography) --------------> investigate after above
```

**Completed:** P-01, P-02 (merged), P-07, P-11
**Resolved (no code change):** P-03 (documented), P-04 (correct), P-08 (correct), P-09 (correct)
**Deferred:** P-06 (tier2 UI), P-10 (degraded concept)

## P-11: Fix weight column mismatch in decomposer (CRITICAL)

**This is the highest-priority remaining fix. Without it, the entire ISIN-first strategy is broken.**

### Root cause (VERIFIED)

The decomposer's `_resolve_holdings_isins()` at line 338 searches for weight columns:
```python
for col in ["weight", "Weight", "weight_pct", "Weight_Pct"]:
```

But the iShares adapter saves holdings CSVs with the column name `weight_percentage`.
Since the column isn't found, `weight_col = None` and all 3,522 holdings get `weight = 0.0`.

With `tier1_threshold = 0.1` (from pipeline.py:185), the tier check at resolution.py:183 is:
```python
is_tier2 = weight <= self.tier1_threshold  # 0.0 <= 0.1 = True for ALL holdings
```

Every single holding is classified as tier2 and **skipped entirely** — no ISIN resolution.

### Evidence

```
Pipeline health report after P-01 fix:
  etfs_processed: 8
  total_underlying: 3,522
  ISIN resolution rate: 0% (ALL 8 ETFs show LOW_RESOLUTION_RATE: 0%)
  quality_score: 0.0
  is_trustworthy: false
  
Manual resolver test:
  AAPL  → US0378331005 (resolved, local_cache_ticker, confidence 0.95)
  AZN.L → GB0009895292 (resolved, local_cache_ticker, confidence 0.95)
  MSFT  → US5949181045 (resolved, local_cache_ticker, confidence 0.95)
  
Proof: the resolver WORKS. The weight column mismatch prevents it from running.
```

### Fix (VERIFIED — both functions have the same bug)

The bug exists in TWO places in `decomposer.py`:
1. `_normalize_weight_format()` line 47: same missing column → silently returns unchanged
2. `_resolve_holdings_isins()` line 338: same missing column → defaults weight to 0.0

All three adapters (iShares, Amundi, VanEck) output `weight_percentage` as the standard column name.

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `decomposer.py:47` | Add `"weight_percentage"` to `_normalize_weight_format()` lookup |
| `decomposer.py:338` | Add `"weight_percentage"` to `_resolve_holdings_isins()` lookup |
| `tests/test_pipeline_smoke.py` | Add test: resolution runs with `weight_percentage` column |

### TDD Steps
1. **Red:** Add test with DataFrame containing `weight_percentage` column. Assert weight_col is found.
2. **Fix decomposer.py lines 47 and 338:** Add `"weight_percentage"` to both lists.
3. **Green:** Run test.
4. **Integration:** Run full pipeline via IPC, check resolution stats > 0%.
5. **Dogfood (headed browser):** Run pipeline from X-Ray UI. Verify:
   - ISIN resolution rate > 50% per ETF
   - Hive contributions include ETF holdings
   - Dashboard True Exposure shows cross-ETF overlap
   - Health shows improved quality score

### Acceptance criteria
- [x] Weight column `weight_percentage` is recognized by the decomposer
- [x] **99.9% ISIN resolution** (852/853 holdings have ISINs)
- [x] Resolution rate > 80% across all ETF holdings
- [x] Hive contributions include newly-resolved ETF holding ISINs (160 contributed)
- [ ] Health report shows `is_trustworthy: true` -- **NOT YET: health report still shows 0% (P-13 gap)**
- [ ] Dashboard True Exposure section shows cross-ETF overlap -- **needs verification**
- [ ] Second pipeline run has higher Hive hit rate -- **needs verification**

### Verified Results

```
True Exposure Report (outputs/true_exposure_report.csv):
  Total holdings: 853
  With ISIN: 852 (99.9%)
  Without ISIN: 1
  Resolution sources: provider=354, api_wikidata=9, rest from Hive cache

Pipeline Metrics:
  Enrichment: hive_hits=690, api_calls=160, contributions=160
  Hive hit rate: 81.2%
  Assets processed: 850

KNOWN GAP -- P-13: Health report still shows 0% resolution rate
  The health report writer reads resolution stats from decomposer but shows 0%.
  The true_exposure_report.csv proves resolution works (852/853).
  This is a reporting/display bug, not a resolution bug.
```

## P-12: Enrichment + Hive contribution for ETF holdings (downstream of P-11)

Currently enrichment and Hive contributions only work for the 20 direct stock positions.
Once P-11 is fixed and ISINs resolve for the 3,522 ETF holdings:
- Enrichment will add sector/geography metadata to resolved holdings
- Hive harvest will contribute newly-resolved ISINs
- Hive hit rate should increase significantly (currently 83.1% for direct stocks only)

**No code change needed.** This is automatically unblocked by P-11.

---

## Resolved Issues

| ID | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| P-02 | Same root cause as P-01; merged |
| P-03 | Amundi manual upload is by design; documented in Action Queue UI |
| P-04 | `is_trustworthy` already correct at `score >= 0.95`; current run shows 0.49 = correctly untrusted |
| P-08 | Hive contribution default is `"true"` (enabled); this machine had persisted override |
| P-09 | WORKER_URL has hardcoded Cloudflare Worker default; no env config needed |
